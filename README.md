# Doggo

Personal project; I used HTML and CSS to build a webpage and implemented JavaScript to generate random images of breeds of dogs
and display them on the webpage. Breeds can also be filtered so that only specific ones are added.

## Deployment

Open the html file in any internet browser that supports it.

## Built With

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - The IDE used.
* [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) - Open source, responds to requests with JSON messages.

## Authors

* **Aston Turner** - *Initial work* - [Aston13](https://github.com/Aston13)

## Acknowledgments

* Forever inspired by frontend wizards such as Brian Holt.
